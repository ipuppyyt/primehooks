Thanks for taking the time to contribute to primehooks — a collection of high-quality React hooks. Contributions of all kinds are welcome: bug reports, docs, tests, features, and performance improvements. Please read these guidelines before opening an issue or pull request.

### Code of conduct
By participating, all community members agree to uphold a respectful, inclusive environment.

### Repository setup
Fork the repository and create a feature branch from main for changes. Keep branches focused and small for easier review. Name the branch `hook/hookName` and create a PR.

Use `pnpm` or `npm` for package management and consistent lockfiles. Run `pnpm install` or `npm install` after cloning to set up dependencies.

As this repo is a monorepo, work within the relevant `src` directory. Also add docs referencing other docs from the `docs` directory present in the root.

Ensure the Rules of Hooks are followed and make sure to run `pnpm run build` or `npm run build` to check the type and successful builds

### Documentation
For adding a new hook, add the relevant documentation into the `docs` directory present in the root.

### Commit messages
Use Conventional Commits for clarity and automated release tooling:

feat(useX): add new option Y

fix(useDebounce): correct cleanup on unmount

docs: add usage examples for useToggle

refactor(useFetch): split internal reducer

test(useInterval): add timing edge cases

Include BREAKING CHANGE: notes in body when applicable.

### Pull requests
Ensure all checks pass: build, lint, and type-checking. Include or update tests and docs with code changes.

Reference related issues with closes #123 in the PR description. Provide motivation, approach, and any trade-offs.

Keep PRs focused; large changes should be discussed in an issue before implementation. Draft PRs are welcome for early feedback.

### Filing issues
Before opening an issue, search existing issues and discussions. When filing:

Bug report: include versions, minimal reproduction (CodeSandbox/StackBlitz), expected vs actual behavior, and environment details.

Feature request: describe the use case, API proposal, and prior art; link related issues or libraries for context.

### Release and versioning
primehooks should follow semantic versioning:

Patch: bug fixes that are backward compatible.

Minor: backward-compatible features and improvements.

Major: breaking changes, accompanied by migration notes and deprecations when possible.

### Local checks
Run these before pushing:

`pnpm run lint` — code style and hooks rules

`pnpm run build` — ensure build artifacts compile without type errors

### Getting help
Questions, ideas, or need a review? Open a discussion or a draft PR to get early feedback before writing extensive code. First-time contributors may find “good first issue” and “help wanted” labels useful.

### Conclusion
**Thanks again for contributing to primehooks. Thoughtful issues, focused PRs, and clear tests/docs help keep the hooks reliable for everyone.**
